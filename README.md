This project consists of the visualization of 4 components mainly Carbon Monoxide, Ozone, Sulphur Dioxide, Nitrogen dioxide where we
actually solve the visualization through creating text boxes to display 4 category pollutants.

Created a filled map to show US states along with the table display county names along with code. We also create quarter wise bifurcation
of all 4 pollutants.

We also solve to display the 1st Max hours and max value of each component using cards and we use slicers to display states which can be
interactive with these pollutants.
